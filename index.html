                <p>Dear Visitor,
                Tapti Valley International School is a co-educational K-12 School located at Surat in the South of Gujarat in India.  TVIS is a very special school, made so by a tradition of educational excellence and enjoys the loveliest school settings amongst the schools in the “City of the Future” Surat.
                    I believe our appeal as a school rests in our strong sense of community. My staff makes absolutely certain that everyone is involved in our TVIS Family — and that includes the parents. In such a secure setting, students are free to challenge themselves and take risks that will lead them to realise their full potential. More importantly you will find a school with warmth. TVIS students and their parents will find themselves part of an extraordinarily friendly community, a school that is both welcoming and warm and unpretentious and one where the students and the staff get on exceptionally well together.
                    Although we maintain the traditional values, we are keenly aware of the kind of knowledge and experience our students will need to succeed in the future. Talk to any of our teachers and you will find an openness to adopting new teaching ideas, that strengthen and enhance our programs. It is this combination of tradition and innovation that will prepare our students for continued success in their life.
                    Recognizing how impressionable the school years are in a child’s life; at TVIS we inspire a love for learning that lasts a lifetime. Our goal is that students leave TVIS with inquisitiveness about their world and a belief in education that they will keep throughout their lives. We aim to produce well-rounded, articulate and confident young people who are well equipped to face the world outside the School. We are able to offer a wonderful range of indoor and outdoor activities, sports, field trips, day camps, hikes, drama, art and music woven seamlessly into the school day. This approach successfully addresses individual learning styles, aptitudes and needs from remedial to gifted.
                    The TVIS teachers are role models and double as, coaches and tutors. This tight knit community helps to promote personal-worth and accountability. While meeting the individual needs of each student, TVIS also asks each child to contribute his particular aptitudes or skills to the TVIS family.
                    TVIS addresses the intellectual, social and ethical needs of the school student in a supportive atmosphere. We aspire to help each child embrace a joyful and healthy life. The priority for me is the welfare of the children and all of us here at TVIS are striving hard to be certain that every single boy and girl is happy. However let me emphasise that TVIS is a thinking-doing school where the children experience the joy of learning without compromising on the rigour required for excellence and also discover a passion for learning that lasts their lifetime
TVIS has much to offer that I hope that you will come and see for yourself. We have tried our best to incorporate as much information as possible on this website which will be useful for you as parent or as a student or someone who has accidentally come across this site while browsing the net. I assure you that we will keep this site updated so that you will like visiting us frequently.
